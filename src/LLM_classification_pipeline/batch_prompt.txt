Follow these steps to analyze each conversation:  
1. **Identify the user's goal**: What does the user want to achieve?  
2. **Evaluate the system's performance** based on:  
  - **Tone**: Is the tone friendly, neutral, or frustrating?  
  - **Accuracy**: Are the responses correct, partially correct, or incorrect?  
  - **Completion**: Were the user's requests fully, partially, or not addressed?  
3. Assign scores to each factor:  
  - Tone: Positive (+1), Neutral (0), Negative (-1)  
  - Accuracy: Fully accurate (+1), Partially accurate (+0.5), Incorrect (-1)  
  - Completion: Fully resolved (+1), Partially resolved (+0.5), Unresolved (-1)  
4. **Calculate total score** and classify satisfaction:  
  - **High**: Total ≥ 2.5  
  - **Medium**: Total between 1.0 and 2.5  
  - **Low**: Total < 1.0  

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Low Satisfaction**  
This conversation demonstrates system misunderstanding and limited solutions. The system fails to meet the user's needs, repeatedly offering irrelevant or unavailable options.  
USER: I need a three-star hotel with internet. Can you help?  
SYSTEM: I'm sorry, I cannot help you with hotels. Are you sure that's what you're looking for?  
USER: I'm sorry. I meant to ask for information on a restaurant. It's called the Stazione Restaurant and Coffee Bar.  
SYSTEM: The Stazione Restaurant is an expensive, Italian restaurant located in the center area. Would you like me to make you a booking today?  
USER: Yes, sounds wonderful. Can you book a table for 7 at 12:00 on Saturday?  
SYSTEM: The booking was successful. Your table will be reserved for 15 minutes, and your reference number is TA6XS4CY.  
USER: Does it have vegetarian options?  
SYSTEM: Yes, they have both vegan and vegetarian dishes. What else may I help you with?  
USER: Can I get free Wi-Fi here?  
SYSTEM: The Stazione Restaurant and Coffee Bar doesn't offer free Wi-Fi at this time.  
USER: Thanks! Do you have a phone number so I can find the entrance fee?  
SYSTEM: I'm sorry, I do not have any more information about this restaurant. Would you like me to try another?  

**Score:** Tone (0), Accuracy (+0.5), Completion (-1) → **Low Satisfaction**

#### **Example 2: Medium Satisfaction**  
The system partially fulfills the user's needs but fails to provide complete solutions, leading to some frustration.  
USER: I need a train leaving Peterborough after 21:45.  
SYSTEM: The first train leaves at 21:48.  
USER: That won't work for me. When does the next one leave on Tuesday?  
SYSTEM: I have one leaving at 22:19. Would you like to book it?  
USER: Yes, that time works. Please book it. What is the train ID?  
SYSTEM: The train ID is TR8054. May I have your details (Name, Phone number, ID, email) so I can go ahead and make the booking for you?  
USER: Are there parking facilities at the station?  
SYSTEM: You can park at the station. There may be a fee, but it depends on the station. May I have your credit card information to book it?  
USER: I don't feel comfortable giving that to you. I'll book on my own. Can you just give me info on a place to stay?  
SYSTEM: Certainly. What area of town would you like to stay in?  
USER: I need a room. Do not need Wi-Fi or parking.  
SYSTEM: Okay, I have the Alpha-Milton Guest House in the north area. Will that work for you?  
USER: Does the hotel offer concierge service?  
SYSTEM: Concierge service is not available at the hotel. Would you like to book a reservation?  
USER: Yes, and can you book it for me and get a reference number?  

**Score:** Tone (+1), Accuracy (+0.5), Completion (+0.5) → **Medium Satisfaction**
